Goal:
The objective of this project is to design and implement a scalable, real-time data engineering pipeline using Microsoft Azure services. The pipeline processes data from the AdventureWorks dataset, transforming it into a structured format for analytics and reporting.

Business Problem:
AdventureWorks, a fictional multinational bicycle manufacturer, needs a centralized data solution to:

	1) Consolidate data from multiple sources.
	2) Improve data quality, transformation, and reporting.
	3) Enable real-time analytics for business insights.
	4) Support Power BI dashboards for decision-making.

Solution Architecture:
To address these challenges, built an end-to-end data pipeline using:

1) Data Source (AdventureWorks Database - HTTP API)

	Extracted Calendar, Customers, Product_Categories, Product_SubCategories, Products, Returns, Sales_2015, Sales_2016, Sales_2017, Territoriessales data from the 	AdventureWorks OLTP database via an API.

2) Data Ingestion (Azure Data Factory - ADF)

	Used ADF pipelines to fetch data and load it into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2 - Bronze Layer).

3) Raw Data Storage (Bronze Layer - ADLS Gen2)

	Stored raw, unprocessed data in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2) for durability and future processing.

4) Data Processing & Transformation (Silver Layer - Databricks & Spark)

	Used Azure Databricks (Apache Spark) to clean, transform, and enrich the data.
	Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and applied business rules.
	Saved processed data back to ADLS Gen2 (Silver Layer).

5) Data Warehouse (Gold Layer - Azure Synapse Analytics)

	Loaded structured data into Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient querying & analytics.
	Created fact and dimension tables for optimized data modeling.

7)Data Visualization & Reporting (Power BI)

	Connected Power BI to Azure Synapse Analytics for interactive dashboards.
