Azure Resources Setup for AdventureWorks Data Pipeline:

Overview:
A step-by-step approach to setting up the necessary Azure resources to build an end-to-end data pipeline for the AdventureWorks dataset. The setup includes:

1) Azure Data Factory (ADF) – For data ingestion
2) Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) – For data storage
3) Azure Databricks – For data transformation
4) Azure Synapse Analytics – For data warehousing

Step-by-Step Setup Guide:

1️) Create an Azure Storage Account (ADLS Gen2):
Purpose: Store raw, cleaned, and transformed data in a hierarchical structure.

Steps:

	Go to Azure Portal → Search Storage Account → Click Create.
	Subscription: Select your subscription.
	Resource Group: Create a new one or select an existing one.
	Storage Account Name: Enter a unique name.
	Region: Select a region closest to your users.
	Performance: Standard.
	Redundancy: Select Locally Redundant Storage (LRS).
	Enable Hierarchical Namespace (for ADLS Gen2).
	Click Review + Create → Click Create.

Create Containers in ADLS Gen2:

	Go to the Storage Account → Containers.
	Click + Container → Name it bronze for raw data.
	Repeat to create silver (cleaned data) and gold (aggregated data).

2️) Set Up Azure Data Factory (ADF):
Purpose: Extract data from the AdventureWorks API and load it into ADLS Gen2.

Steps:

	Go to Azure Portal → Search Data Factory → Click Create.
	Subscription & Resource Group: Use the same as the Storage Account.
	Region: Select the same region as ADLS Gen2.
	Name: Enter a unique name.
	Version: Choose V2 (latest version).
	Click Review + Create → Click Create.

Create Linked Services in ADF:

	Go to Manage → Linked Services → + New.
	Select HTTP → Configure API URL, Authentication, and Headers.
	Select Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 → Connect using Managed Identity.
	Click Test Connection → Create.

3️) Deploy Azure Databricks:
Purpose: Transform and clean raw data into usable formats.

Steps:

	Go to Azure Portal → Search Azure Databricks → Click Create.
	Subscription & Resource Group: Select existing ones.
	Workspace Name: Enter a unique name.
	Region: Same as ADLS Gen2.
	Pricing Tier: Choose Standard.
	Click Review + Create → Create.

Create a Databricks Cluster:

	Open Databricks Workspace.
	Go to Clusters → Create Cluster.
	Select Single Node or Multi-Node based on requirements.
	Choose Databricks Runtime Version (latest).
	Set Worker Type and Driver Type.
	Click Create Cluster.

Connect Databricks to ADLS Gen2:

	Create a Service Principal in Azure Active Directory.
	Assign Storage Blob Data Contributor role to the Service Principal.
	Use a Mount Point in Databricks to access ADLS Gen2:

	dbutils.fs.mount(
    	source="wasbs://bronze@adventureworksdatalake.blob.core.windows.net/",
    	mount_point="/mnt/bronze",
    	extra_configs={"fs.azure.account.key.adventureworksdatalake.blob.core.windows.net": "your-access-key"})

4️) Set Up Azure Synapse Analytics: DWH
Purpose: Store processed data for reporting and BI.

Steps:

	Go to Azure Portal → Search Synapse Analytics → Click Create.
	Subscription & Resource Group: Select existing ones.
	Workspace Name: Enter a unique name
	Region: Same as ADLS Gen2.
	Enable Data Lake Storage and select your ADLS Gen2 account.
	Click Review + Create → Create.

Connect Synapse to ADLS Gen2:

	Open Synapse Studio → Manage → Linked Services.
	Click + New → Select Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
	Provide Storage Account Name and Authentication Method.
	Click Test Connection → Create.

Create External Tables in Synapse:

-------------------------------------
----CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE EXTTABLE---
-------------------------------------

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE gold.extsales
WITH
(
    LOCATION = 'extsales',
    DATA_SOURCE = source_gold,
    FILE_FORMAT = format_parquet
)
AS
SELECT * FROM gold.sales

----Query The External Table----
SELECT * FROM gold.extsales

5️) Connect Power BI for Reporting:
Purpose: Visualize data for business insights.

Steps:

	Open Power BI Desktop.
	Click Get Data → Choose Azure Synapse Analytics.
	Enter Server Name and Database Name.
	Click Connect → Load Tables into Power BI.
	Create Dashboards & Reports.
