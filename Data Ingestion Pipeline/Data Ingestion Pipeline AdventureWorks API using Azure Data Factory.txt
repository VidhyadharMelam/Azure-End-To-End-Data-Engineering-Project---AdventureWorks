Data Ingestion Pipeline: AdventureWorks API using Azure Data Factory

Overview:

A detailed explanation of how data from the AdventureWorks API was ingested using Azure Data Factory (ADF). The ingestion process ensures scalability, automation, and reliability by extracting, transforming, and loading raw data into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2 - Bronze Layer).

Goal:

	The primary goal of this data ingestion pipeline is to automate the extraction of data from an external API and store it in a structured format for further 	processing. This allows for:

	Real-time or scheduled ingestion

	Efficient data storage

	Reliable and scalable processing

	Seamless integration with downstream analytics tools

Data Ingestion Process:

1️) Data Source: AdventureWorks API

	Source: AdventureWorks REST API

	Data Type: JSON

	Authentication: API Key-based authentication

Data Challenges:

	Handling rate limits and pagination

	Managing missing fields and null values

	Incremental loading to avoid duplicate records

2️) Data Ingestion: Azure Data Factory (ADF)

	The ADF pipeline was designed to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of AdventureWorks API data into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS 	Gen2).

Pipeline Components:

	Linked Services: Connects ADF to the API endpoint and ADLS Gen2 storage.

	Datasets: Defines JSON data schema for API responses.

	Copy Activity: Extracts data from the API and loads it into the Bronze Layer.

	ForEach Activity: Iterates through multiple API endpoints.

	Incremental Load Mechanism: Uses watermarking to fetch only new or updated records.

	Triggers: Configured to run at 15-minute intervals for near real-time ingestion.

	Error Handling & Logging: Stores logs in Azure Monitor and ADLS Gen2 for debugging.

3️) Data Storage: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (Bronze Layer)

	Raw API data is stored without transformation to maintain data integrity.

	File format: JSON/Parquet for optimized storage and query performance.

	Partitioning based on date and data type for efficient retrieval.

Step-by-Step Implementation:

	Step 1: Create Linked Services

	Linked Service 1: API Connection (HTTP)

	Linked Service 2: ADLS Gen2 (Storage Account)

Step 2: Define Datasets

	Dataset 1: API Source (JSON Format)

	Dataset 2: ADLS Destination (Parquet Format)

Step 3: Develop ADF Pipeline

	Copy Activity: Extracts data from the API.

	ForEach Loop: Iterates over multiple API endpoints.

	Mapping & Schema: Ensures consistent data structure.

	Error Handling: Captures API failures & stores logs in ADLS.

	Triggers: Schedules pipeline execution every 15 minutes.

Step 4: Deploy & Monitor

	Deployed pipeline using Azure ADF

	Monitored data ingestion through Azure Monitor & Log Analytics.

	Challenges & Solutions:

	API Rate Limits : Implemented retry mechanism with exponential backoff

	Handling Large Data Volumes : Used incremental loading & partitioning strategies

	Data Quality Issues : Applied validation checks in Databricks (Silver Layer)

	Pipeline Failures : Configured automated alerts & logging


Business Impact

	Automated real-time ingestion to support analytics.
	Improved data quality & governance with structured storage.
	Scalable architecture for future business expansion.
	Optimized processing for efficient BI reporting.
