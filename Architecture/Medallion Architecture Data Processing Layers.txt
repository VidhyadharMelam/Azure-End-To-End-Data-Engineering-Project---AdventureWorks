Medallion Architecture: Data Processing Layers

1) Bronze Layer (Raw Data) - Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2)
	Purpose: Store raw, unprocessed data exactly as ingested from the AdventureWorks source (OLTP database via API).

	Data Characteristics:
	Contains raw, unstructured, or semi-structured data.
	Data is stored in its original format.
	No transformations or cleaning applied yet.

Implementation:

	Azure Data Factory (ADF) extracts raw data and loads it into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2 - Bronze Layer).
	Data is stored in partitioned folders based on date and category (e.g., Sales, Customers, Products).

2) Silver Layer (Cleaned & Processed Data) - Databricks + ADLS Gen2
	Purpose: Clean, transform, and standardize data for analytical processing.

	Data Processing Steps:
	Deduplication, missing value handling, and schema enforcement.
	Normalization and standardization of fields (e.g., date formats, currency conversions).
	Data joins to create enriched datasets (e.g., joining Sales and Customer tables).

Implementation:

	Azure Databricks (Apache Spark) is used for ETL processing.
	Cleaned and structured data is stored back into ADLS Gen2 - Silver Layer in Parquet format for better performance.
	Data partitioning is applied for optimized querying.

3Ô∏è) Gold Layer (Aggregated & Analytics-Ready Data) - Azure Synapse Analytics
	Purpose: Stored curated, aggregated, and query-optimized data for BI & reporting.

Data Processing Steps:
	Fact & Dimension modeling (Star Schema).
	Business aggregations (e.g., total sales per region, top customers).

Implementation:

	Azure Synapse Analytics (Serverless SQL Pools) stores structured, analytics-ready data.
	Gold data is queried directly in Power BI for real-time reports and dashboards.

Why Medallion Architecture?
	Scalability: Handles raw, cleaned, and aggregated data efficiently.
	Data Quality: Ensures proper validation before analysis.
	Performance: Optimized for fast queries and BI reporting.
	Flexibility: Can support both batch and real-time processing.
