Data Transformation: AdventureWorks Data Processing

Overview:
How raw data from the AdventureWorks API was transformed into structured, high-quality data for analytics and reporting. The transformation process follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold), ensuring data quality, consistency, and efficiency.

1) Bronze Layer – Stores raw data without modifications.
2) Silver Layer – Cleansed, structured, and enriched business-ready data.
3) Gold Layer – Aggregated data optimized for reporting.

Data Transformation Process:

1️) Bronze Layer (Raw Data Storage – ADLS Gen2)
	Data Source: JSON data from AdventureWorks API
	Storage Format: JSON files partitioned by date

Issues with Raw Data:
	Missing or null values
	Inconsistent data types
	Duplicates
	Complex JSON structures

2️) Silver Layer (Data Cleansing & Enrichment – Databricks & ADLS Gen2)
Tool Used: Azure Databricks (Apache Spark)

Transformations Applied:
	1) Schema Enforcement: Converts JSON into structured tabular format.
	2) Handling Missing Values: Uses default values or removes incomplete records.
	3) Data Type Standardization: Converts numbers, dates, and Boolean values correctly.
	4) Flattening JSON Structures: Extracts nested fields into relational tables.
	5) Deduplication: Removes duplicate records based on CustomerID & OrderID.
	6) Deriving New Columns: Extracts insights like customer lifetime value (CLV), first purchase date, and frequency of orders.

3️) Gold Layer (Aggregated Data – Azure Synapse Analytics)
Tool Used: Azure Synapse Analytics

Business-Level Aggregations:
	Sales Summary: Total revenue, average order value, sales trends.
	Customer Segmentation: Identifies high-value customers.
	Product Performance: Top-selling products, revenue contribution.
